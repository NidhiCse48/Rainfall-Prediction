# Rainfall-Prediction
Predicting rainfall is crucial for 🌾 agriculture, 🌊 water management, and ☔ disaster prevention. This project leverages Machine Learning algorithms to analyze historical weather data — such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure — to predict the likelihood of rain in a given region.
